# DiscordNetBot
A Discord Bot with basic slash commands and funny restful APIs using .NET Core 3.1 and Discord.NET 3.3.2

# Initial Setup:
* After you've created your bot in the Discord Developer Portal:
  * Add your BOT TOKEN and CHANNEL ID into the appsettings.json file


  * Replace 'BOT_ID' with your BOT ID in the following link to invite the bot to your server: 
  https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT_ID&permissions=515396521024&scope=bot%20applications.commands
  
  * 'Slash1HelpModule.cs' - there are some commands in here ("send-to-admin" and "invite-link") that will require your CHANNEL ID or BOT ID in order to work.
